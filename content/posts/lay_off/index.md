After three weeks (not full-time, part-time, sometimes with workdays without work) I was laid off my work in the warehouse of [Inpost](https://inpost.pl/en). I enjoyed being employed for the first time in my life and thought it would last longer. The work wasn't that hard, I could even listen to music or podcasts in one ear for the duration. I'm going to look for another job, probably in the warehouse as well. The "funny" thing is that they have fired almost everyone from the lowest paid positions and replaced us with new blood, which I saw when I came to pack my things. Business is really good,[^1] but I and a dozen other people were fired anyway.

[^1]: According to [this](https://ceo.com.pl/inpost-z-rekordowymi-wynikami-w-2023-roku-i-optymistycznymi-planami-na-przyszlosc-86781) they had a record year.
