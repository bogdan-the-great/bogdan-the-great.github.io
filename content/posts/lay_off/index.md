After three weeks (not full-time, part-time, sometimes with workdays without work) I was laid off my work in the warehouse of [Inpost](https://inpost.pl/en). I enjoyed being employed for the first time in my life and thought it would last longer. The work wasn't that hard, I could even listen to music or podcasts in one ear for the duration. I'm going to look for another job, probably in the warehouse as well. The "funny" thing is that they have fired almost everyone from the lowest paid positions and replaced us with new blood*, which I saw when I came to pack my things. [Business is really good](https://ceo.com.pl/inpost-z-rekordowymi-wynikami-w-2023-roku-i-optymistycznymi-planami-na-przyszlosc-86781), but I and a dozen other people were made redundant anyway.

## Update: I got my first paycheck! It was 843 PLN (about 216 USD today), they cut my working hours and didn't register a few working days (I worked about 10 days, but they had 7 in their database).

\*At the moment there are a lot of Ukrainians in Poland and you could say we were replaced by cheaper labor, but that's not true.
