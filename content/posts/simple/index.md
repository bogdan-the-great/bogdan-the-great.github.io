All about minimal software and how to stop being an optimizing junkie.

## The root of all our problems

As we all know, today's applications are huge in size and resources. This calls for alternative solutions that are by design more fragmented, modular, and generally lighter. While they create many opportunities, the troubled mind can get trapped in their modularity - tweaking and optimizing irrelevant parts of them for the sake of that person's optimization crusade. This leaves the technologically handicapped individual with a smile on his or her face.

## "But at least it's minimal!"

A good example of this is how you can optimize and slim down your Linux system by using a lighter distribution, tools and programs. You can also learn more about the insides of your operating system and your personal preferences. This is great, and I went to great lengths to make it smaller and more optimized for my personal workflow. It worked great, but when complicated or unknown problems arose, I couldn't tame them because my whole system was designed to solve specific problems and wasn't prepared for the unexpected. To solve them, I had to let go of some of my minimalist desires.

## Is there salvation?

I believe that when you cut something down, you need to replace the cut parts - not throw them away. You have to be smart about it, and choose or create your tools wisely, or you will end up with a worse system that you were trying to leave behind in the first place. For every "And how would you do X on your PC?" you need an answer.

## Where the hypocrisy comes in

In my [last post](../stagnation), I wrote about getting comfortable when not improving and testing new things, which leads to stagnation of your skills. It may sound like I'm all for optimizing everything in fear of stagnation. This is the ultimate challenge to overcome - how do I get out of my comfort zone and stay productive or even get better?

I think the solution is to approach our problems from many different angles and try to take small steps in the right direction. When we change something, we first try to provide the same functionality (which may require additional work, but that is okay) and then improve it - add more functionality to the now fully known base.

Leaving everything behind and living alone in the woods may be your preference, but now you have to do everything all by yourself. On the other hand, if everyone does everything for you, then you have no desire to improve, because everything is already provided for you.
