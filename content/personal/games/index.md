My list of the best video games of all time.
<!--more-->

I spend most of my time playing on the PC, but I also have PS4 and played some exclusives there. I don't think that I'll buy another console anytime soon. Also I'm here talking about the whole franchise (or otherwise specified).

- [Battlefield 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_4) - Literally my favourite game of all time, you feel like a soldier in a conflict, there is so much you can do in it. Graphics, maps, guns, modes and gameplay are amazing. I sometimes come back to it and still have fun. I hope it lives another 10 years.
- [Fallout: New Vegas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout%3A_New_Vegas) - The best Fallout game.
- [Witcher 3: Wild Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_3%3A_Wild_Hunt) - It is necessary to play it if you are Polish, but still a really good game with the best DLC of all time (Blood and Wine).
- [Deep Rock Galactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Rock_Galactic) - Super fun and lightweight co-op to play with friends.
- [Deus Ex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex) - I recommend everyone to play these Immersive Sims. You are free in any way how to approach an objective.
- [Half Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game)) - Revolutionary series of really good games.
- [Yakuza/Like a Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza_(franchise)) - "GTA in Japan", but there is more to it - interesting story, good gameplay, funny and serious aspects interchanging. You play Yakuza 0 and then decide whether play the other ones.
- [Ghost of Tsushima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_of_Tsushima) - Really good Assasin's Creed in Japan. Also my first contact with Japanese language and culture. Beautiful scenery and good fighting mechanics. Play it instead of any Assasin's Creed.
- [Uncharted 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted_4:_A_Thief%27s_End) - The best of Naughty Dog. A 15 hour movie with action, exploration and puzzles - all with the best pacing possible.
