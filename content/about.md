I'm an IT student. Right now I'm really interested in GNU/Linux and software for it. I really like programming and would like to continue my career in this field. I also like things to be relatively simple so that I can tinker with them.


Read about my projects in [projects](../projects) or on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/bogdan-the-great) and [Github](https://github.com/bogdan-the-great). My dotfiles are available on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/bogdan-the-great/dotfiles).

I'm from Poland, where I'm currently studying computer science. I speak Polish, English and Spanish (still learning).
