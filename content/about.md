Right now I'm really interested in Linux and software for it. I really like programming and would like to continue my career in this field. I like to tinker with software (and more or less hardware). I support the [Right To Repair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_repair) movement and I'm a [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) enthusiast. My hobby is learning languages.

Read about my projects in [projects](../projects) or on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/marendowski) and [Github](https://github.com/marendowski). My dotfiles are available on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/marendowski/dotfiles).

I'm from Poland, where I'm currently studying Computer Science. I speak Polish, English and Spanish.
